# Probabilistic Packet Filter

## Overview

The **Probabilistic Packet Filter** is a Rust-based implementation of an efficient, memory-optimized packet classification system. It uses a bit-array-based hash structure to minimize storage while maintaining quick lookup times.

This project is inspired by research on space-time trade-offs in hash coding, particularly focusing on reducing memory overhead in network packet filtering applications.
The project will test Bloom Filter performance by similuating the following scenearios:

1. DDOS Attacks
2. Network Intrusion Detection and Prevention (NIDS/NIPS)
3. Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) & Caching
4. Load Balancing in High-Traffic Networks
