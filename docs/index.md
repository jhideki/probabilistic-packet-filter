# Probabilistic Packet Filter

## Overview

The **Probabilistic Packet Filter** is a Rust-based implementation of an efficient, memory-optimized packet classification system. It uses a bit-array-based hash structure to minimize storage while maintaining quick lookup times.

This project is inspired by research on space-time trade-offs in hash coding, particularly focusing on reducing memory overhead in network packet filtering applications.
